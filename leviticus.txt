The book of Leviticus
Introduction:
The third book of the Torah is called “Leviticus” because a good part of this book deals with concerns of priests, who are of the tribe of Levi. It focuses on sacrifices, offerings, priesthood and the operation of the sanctuary. It is a book explaining the Law to the Israelites. It continues forward after the narrative of Exodus.
•	The first 7 chapters discuss Ritual Sacrifices
•	Chapters 8-10 discuss Ceremony of Ordination
•	Chapters 11-16 discuss Laws regarding Purity

•	Chapter 27 discusses Redemption of Offerings
Where is Jesus?
He is the tabernacle, the sacrifice, the lamb, the Day of Atonement, the Jubilee.
Leviticus chapter 1
In Leviticus 1, God provides detailed instructions about burnt offerings, which were to be sacrificed for the atonement of sins. The offering had to be fully consumed on the altar, symbolizing complete surrender and pointing to Jesus on the cross. Each person who brought a sacrifice was required to offer it with sincere worship, emphasizing that our faith in Jesus must also be genuine and heartfelt.
Faith is not merely a one-time declaration but a lifelong journey of love and devotion to Jesus. While our actions reflect our faith, it is important to remember that they are not what save us; salvation comes through grace. Our deeds are a response to the love we have for Jesus, demonstrating the sincerity of our faith.
The offerings, which could include a lamb or goat, prefigure Jesus as the Lamb of God who was sacrificed for our sins. His sacrifice is the ultimate, once-for-all offering that atones for humanity's sins. The aroma of the burnt offering was pleasing to the Lord because it represented the perfect sacrifice of Jesus, through whom people are made righteous before God and granted access to heaven. The doves and pigeons are representative of baptism and the Holy Spirit which came onto Jesus like a dove when he got baptized.
In verse 11 the offering had to be slaughtered in the north side because Jesus was killed in Calvary which was on the north side of Jerusalem.
Since sin separates us from God, God didn’t want us to be separated from Him so he made the sacrificial system so that the people would see the seriousness of their sins. Also, by having the Law they will find out that they cannot manage to keep all of it and that they are in desperate need of a savior who can set them free from their sin forever.
Leviticus chapter 2
This chapter highlights the significance of grain offerings as a way to honor God. The first offering had to be unleavened bread which symbolizes purity and points to Christ, who lived a sinless life. Salt was also an important part of the offering, representing preservation and a lasting relationship with God. This simple act of bringing grain seasoned with salt was a way of showing devotion and faithfulness to the Lord. The Bible describes this offering as a "sweet aroma" to God, reminding us of the perfection of Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice is the ultimate act of love and redemption. Jesus also calls His followers the "salt of the earth" (Matthew 5:13), showing that we, through Him, are meant to bring goodness, preservation, and hope to the world. By believing in Him and living out our faith, we reflect His purity and love in our lives. This teaches us that even the simplest things, when done for God, can have deep meaning and eternal significance.
Leviticus chapter 3
The focus of this chapter is the peace offerings which were representing the communion between man and God. The offerings weren’t completely consumed when sacrificed, instead, they were shared between God, the priest and the person who was giving the offering. This foreshadows Christ as He became human from a divine form and lived among us not only sharing His peace, wisdom and majesty but also sharing His blood and body which we celebrate and get to receive in the Eucharist.
Leviticus chapter 4
In this chapter we see what priests and regular people who have sinned had to do to receive forgiveness. Regular people had to bring a goat to the priest who would sacrifice it and then the person would receive forgiveness. This sacrificial system foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who gave His life for the forgiveness of our sins. In a similar cense today in the Catholic church when we go to confession, we confess our sins to the priest and to the Lord at the same time and then the priest makes the confession valid or invalid, assigns penance, which helps us turn back to God wholeheartedly.
Lord, grant me a contrite heart, open to Your mercy and healing. Help me to turn away from sin and embrace Your grace. Thank You for the gift of forgiveness and reconciliation. Amen.
Leviticus chapter 5
The Lord says that if someone has information about something important and refuses to talk about it or withhold information when others ask then he has sinned. When someone makes a promise to someone than he has made a promise to God and has to keep it. If he fails, then he has sinned and needs forgiveness. God wants us to be people of truth and do what we say. When we ask for forgiveness, the high priest makes atonement for our sins which implies that Jesus is the high priest that gives our confessions to the Father which forgives us. God lists different items we can sacrifice for these types of sins going from a lamb to grain which means that this forgiveness is available to all.
When we sin without knowing that is still considered sin and we have broken God’s commandments for which we will be judged. A sin is always a sin because God is Holy and will not make excuses. There is also always forgiveness and grace. When we confess, we should also apologize for the sins that we don’t know we have committed so that God could forgive us.
Leviticus chapter 6
This chapter talks about the daily offerings. The priest is required to keep the fire burning on the altar and to offer sacrifices regularly. This fire has to be burning at all times symbolizes that Jesus’s death on the cross isn’t a one-time event but has eternal significance, paying for our sins once and for all. The requirement for daily offerings reflects that God is always present and available to us. It reminds us that we should seek Him daily, living in constant repentance and faith, acknowledging the Lord’s sacrifice and grace continually.
Leviticus chapter 7
The instructions of the peace offerings are given in verses 11-18. The meat had to be eaten on the same day and only people who were clean could eat it. It had to be consumed because it would rapidly spoil so that people would not think that meat had some sort of spiritual presence. If someone would disobey these rules, they would be “cut off” from his people because God requires them to be pure.
Leviticus chapter 8
The chapter shows the ordaining process of the priests which were Aaron and his son’s. This process took seven days meaning it was a process that wasn’t rushed and is a symbol of the seven days of God’s creation. It shows that becoming a priest is a serious act and should not be taken lightly as Aaron and his sons could not leave the tent and engage in any sinful activities for the seven days otherwise, they would have died. If a person wants to become a priest, they have to be called and chosen by God just like God chose only Aaron and his sons to be the high priests. The priest must go all in for God getting rid of sinful behavior and wicked acts for the rest of his life. The Old Testament priesthood starts here; however, it is different from the New Covenant as it required repeated offerings whereas Jesus through His one sacrifice once and for all paid the debt for all of our sins. (CCC 1539-1543)
8:6 The priests had to be washed with water just like all believers have to be washed with the Holy Spirit in the Sacrament of Baptism. In Ephesians 5 Paul identifies water as the Word of God (Ephesians 5:25-27). The Word of God prepares us for service by cleansing our soul and purifying our spirit. The more we read the Word, the more we focus on Jesus instead of our sin. The Holy Spirit works in us even when we are reading passages that are boring or hard to understand. At the right time, the Holy Spirit will put the pieces together in a way that we will understand them.
8:14-24 The blood was applied to the ear, the thumb and big toe because we things we hear, the things we do and the places we go can pollute us which is why we need blood that will cleanse us and that blood is the blood of Jesus Christ.
Leviticus chapter 9
After the ordination process, the priests had to bring three offerings: a sin offering, a burnt offering and meal offering. The first offering was the sin offering which tells us that before we can be used by the Lord, we have to be right with the Lord in regard to sin. We must confess our sins to Him and then do good works, otherwise they might be hindered.
9:22 After Aaron left the tabernacle, he blessed the people. This can be applied to us. After we read the Word of God and stay in God’s presence, we should go out and by the power of the Holy Spirit bless others by doing good works. We should also share the Word of God to other unbelievers.
9:23-24 When God revealed His glory to His people, He revealed His righteousness, holiness, truth, wisdom, and grace. This glory was also revealed by His son Jesus which we can experience today by reading His Word “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth” (John 1:14). This sign was so beautiful that the people shouted for joy, which implies worship, and fell on their faces out of respect.
Leviticus chapter 10
10:1-2 When Nadab and Abihu disobeyed God, the fire consumed them, and they were killed instantly. This teaches us that we must follow God’s commands carefully and with respect. While disobeying God today might not lead to immediate consequences, those who reject Jesus for their entire lives will face judgment on the Last Day. Jesus is the only way to heaven, so we must trust in His sacrifice and live according to His will for the rest of our lives. Nadab and Abihu are an example of people who believed in God and followed His commands but later chose to disobey and break His rules. They had witnessed God’s glory and gone through the entire process of preparation—they were washed, robed, anointed with oil and blood, and even stayed in the tabernacle for seven days. Yet, they threw all of this away when they disobeyed God. Similarly, even after following Jesus, we still disobey Him by sinning (like Peter, who knew Jesus well but denied Him three times). However, we have something Nadab and Abihu did not—the opportunity to change our ways and repent. Their quick deaths show that life can end at any moment and that we shouldn’t put off God until later in life as we don’t know when death will catch us.
10:5-7 Moses instructed Aaron and his family not to mourn the deaths of Nadab and Abihu. Though it may seem unfair that their lives were taken so quickly, God’s plan is always perfect. Their deaths demonstrate the seriousness of rejecting God. Without this event, we wouldn’t learn this important lesson, and the significance of this chapter might have been lost over time.
10:16-20 Eleazar and Ithamar also disobeyed God by not eating the meat in the Holy Place. However, unlike Nadab and Abihu, they were not struck down but were given a warning by Moses and were allowed to continue living. This highlights God’s grace and patience. Even when we break His law, He often gives us opportunities to repent, turn away from sin, and continue living in obedience.
Leviticus chapter 11
God reveals which animals cannot be touched or eaten because they would make people unclean. God wants us to be clean and not defiled because we are called to be holy as He is holy (Leviticus 11:45). These rules about clean and unclean animals affected ritual purity and did not directly address sin. God prohibited eating these animals because the listed animals were filthy and fed on filthy things such as mud. God wanted to prevent us from catching diseases, He cares for our health. Fat is forbidden because it contributes to heart disease. It’s not specifically eating that makes you clean or unclean but rather the compliance and obedience to God’s command.
Sin is what truly makes us unclean because sin is breaking the law of God. We can only enter heaven if we are holy and pure, which is why, before we reach heaven, we must go through a purification process to cleanse us of all sins we committed before our death. This process is called purgatory (CCC 1030-1032).
Another reason why God distinguished clean and unclean animals is because the animals’ represented nations. The clean animals represented Israel who was the only clean nation in God’s eyes which was set apart for God’s glory. The other nations were sinful and unclean. God wanted other nations to become clean too and Israel was the set example through which God worked. All the nations, including Jews and Gentiles, were ultimately made clean by the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. In order to become clean, we must accept Jesus by faith, confess with our mouth and He will wash away our sins.
11:3 The cleanliness of animals was determined by how they walked and what they ate. Similarly, when we walk with Jesus, we are made into new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17). There must be a visible difference in our way of living compared to the rest of the world. This difference is shown by the fruits we produce in our lives.
11:13-20 Ravens are considered unclean birds in the Bible, yet in 1 Kings, God uses ravens to bring food to Elijah (1 Kings 17:6). This reminds us that God can use anyone—whether they are a believer or an unbeliever—to fulfill His purpose and carry His message. Because of this, we must treat everyone equally and love our neighbors as ourselves.
11:33-36 An earthen vessel had to be destroyed if an unclean animal touched it. However, if an unclean animal fell into a fountain or a pit of water, the water remained unaffected. This points to Jesus Christ, who is the Living Water (John 4:7). He is not affected by our sins because He is perfect. Instead, He cleanses us and makes us pure if we trust in Him and turn from our old ways.
11:37-40 The seed in this context can symbolize the Word of God, as Peter writes, “Since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God” (1 Peter 1:23). The seed can become unclean for those who do not read it with faith and instead look for faults or mistakes in the text. Rejecting parts of the Word because they do not align with personal understanding can put a person at risk of abandoning their faith. Some things we read in Scripture may be beyond our full understanding, but that does not make them untrue.
Leviticus chapter 12
When a woman gave birth, she was considered unclean and couldn’t participate in tabernacle worship for seven days. This didn’t mean giving birth was a sin; it was simply because the process involved blood, which made her ritually unclean. Being unclean wasn’t sinful, but it meant the person couldn’t take part in ceremonies in the tabernacle, which was a holy place.
The baby was to be circumcised on the eighth day, showing the importance of addressing sin early since circumcision in the Old Testament symbolized what Baptism does for us today. The reason women were considered unclean longer after giving birth to a girl than a boy might be because girls couldn’t be circumcised. Today, God calls us all to have our hearts circumcised—meaning a spiritual transformation—so that we can draw closer to Him and be made clean.
Leviticus chapter 13
Leprosy was considered a very serious disease because there was no cure for it at the time. This chapter is important because it shows how God provided measures to prevent the spread of the disease, including instructions for the people to visit the priest for evaluation. Those who contracted leprosy were deemed unclean and were forced to live apart from their families and communities as outcasts. Leprosy began as small red spots but would spread throughout the body, eventually eating away at the flesh and leading to death. In many ways, it is like sin—starting small, growing over time, disappearing temporarily, and then returning to cause decay and destruction.
In the New Testament, Jesus demonstrated compassion for these outcasts by healing and making them clean (Matthew 8:2–4; Luke 17:11–17). These lepers were healed because they believed in Jesus as Lord and sought Him. If we seek the Lord with all our hearts, He will cleanse us from sin and help us love what is righteous. No sin is too great for God to forgive. Even when sin consumes us, Jesus can make us pure and white as snow.
13:45 The words “Unclean! Unclean!” are a symbol of grief and isolation. This same cry is heard from the survivors of Jerusalem’s destruction (Lamentations 4:15).
Leviticus chapter 14
14:1-3 Even though leprosy was uncurable at that time, it was found that someone had been healed of this disease. This was because they had a similar skin disease to leprosy, however, that disease was curable. After they were cured, they had to visit the priest who confirmed that the person was ritually clean. That is why Jesus says to the lepers He healed to go and visits a priest (Matthew 8:4, Mark 1:44, Luke 5:14, 17:14).
14:4 Wood represents the cross, scarlet represents the blood, hyssop was the brush with which people applied blood in their home during Passover which represents sacrifice.
14:5-7 The birds represent Jesus. The first bird had to be killed because Jesus was killed for our sins and the second bird was let loose because Jesus rose from the dead on the third day. Jesus was also sacrificed outside the camp, outside Jerusalem (Hebrews 13:11-13). Since these people were thought to have leprosy and were alienated from the community, their return could symbolize our return to the Lord. Before we walk with the Lord, we can feel lonely and alienated. When we return to Him and repent, we are made clean. The birds can also be a symbol of Baptism as when Jesus got Baptized, the Holy Spirit descended on Him like a dove (Luke 3:22). The leper was sprinkled seven times because seven is the number of perfection, of completion.
14:8 The person had to shave all his dead and wash himself in the water. When we are Baptized, we become new creatures with new desires and are clean from sin.
14:41-44 If one room of the house is affected by leprosy, then the entire house is affected. If we commit one sin, then our entire body is affected by sin, we break the entire law. Jesus is the cure that heals us. When we repent, we can’t come back to that sin, instead we need to clean our home by letting go of sin.
Leviticus chapter 15
This chapter talks about impurities associated with discharges of male and female reproductive system. When these things happened, God orders people to stay clean, wash themselves with water. This predated medical knowledge by thousands of years by teaching the importance of being clean. If someone is unclean and they come into contact with someone that is clean, their uncleanliness is transferred to the person who is clean. This principle was reversed by Jesus as when we touched an unclean person, He made them clean “And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him.“ (Luke 5:13)
Leviticus chapter 16
The letter to the Hebrews references this passage in order to explain Jesus’ sacrifice. Just like the high priest who would enter the most holy place once a year and would sacrifice the blood of the goat to receive forgiveness of all sins, Jesus entered the holy place once for all and by His blood on the cross, not the blood of the goats, He washed away all past, present and future sins of all humanity (Hebrews 9:12, 24-28).
16:1-2 The high priest could only enter the most holy place once a year and was strictly forbidden to enter it whenever he wanted. A veil in the tabernacle separated the holy, inner room from the rest of the sanctuary in which the Ark of the Covenant was reserved. On the top of the Ark was the mercy seat, which represented the presence of God. Unlike the high priests in the Old Testament, we always have access to the holy of holies (Jesus).
16:5-6 Firstly, the high priest had to make an offering for his sins because he was a sinner too just like the rest of us. But our high priest Jesus didn’t have to make a sacrifice for himself because He was without sin. His sacrifice was for us and all of our sins.
16:7-10 The first goat had to be sacrifices because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) meaning that in order to pay the dept of sin, one must sacrifice himself. The other goat was spared because if we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us (1 John 1:9).
16:44 The blood had to be sprinkled seven times not only because seven is the number of perfection, but because when Jesus died, He bled from seven points. This prefigures that Christ’s sacrifice would be perfect.
16:29 This verse means that people had to fast and not consume any food. The day of Atonement was on the seventh month and tenth day because seven means the number of perfection and ten is the number of moral commandments. We can’t keep the commandment which is why there needs to be a perfect sacrifice for sin. “The day was the most solemn of all the Old Testament rituals. So significant was it that in later Jewish tradition it came to be called just that, ‘The Day’ (Yoma).” (Mark F. Rooker)
Leviticus chapter 17
This chapter focuses on the importance and sacredness of blood. God first orders people not to eat blood as early as Genesis chapter 9:4. Here, He declares that life in the flesh is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11). That is why when Jesus died on the cross and shed his blood, He gave us life. Life belongs to God alone. The blood points to the perfect sacrifice of Jesus. Eating the blood of animals would mean profaning the blood of Jesus. Even though eating blood was prohibited, Jesus orders every believer to drink His blood in John 6. What he meant by drinking His blood was not in a cannibalistic way but instead, He was talking about the Eucharist—the true presence of Christ which gives us life “In him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace.” (Ephesians 1:7)
17:1-4 Any animal slaughtered had to be brought to the tent of meeting as an offering. This is different from Deuteronomy 12:15-28, which allows those living too far from the temple to slaughter an animal for food at home without offering it as a sacrifice.
Leviticus chapter 18
This chapter talks about laws, specifically sexual acts, that are still relevant to this day because breaking them would mean committing adultery. The Lord emphasizes these laws by saying “I am the Lord your God” which shows how serious they are. God wants His nation to not commit these sins to stand out as a nation and to show a good example to other nations.
18:2 This phrase “I am the Lord your God” appears many times in chapters 17-26 to emphasize the importance of the laws and that they are given from the divine lawgiver to the people.
18:3-4 God doesn’t want the nation of Israel to act like they used to in Egypt or like the people of Cannan because He wants the nation to be a good example of faithfulness to God.
18:5 This verse says that people are alive when they try to keep the commandments. This is later changed in the New Testament as we find out that the law is what kills us because we are not able to keep it. We are now justified by believing the Son Jesus Christ who was the one that managed to keep all the laws.
18:6 To uncovering nakedness means to have sexual intercourse. By revealing this, we can interpret seeing the nakedness of the Noah in Genesis 9 to mean that Ham could have had sexual intercourse with Noah’s wife or it was meant to prefigure these kinds of practices of the Canaanites.  In Genesis 9, Shem and Japheth were blessed for covering Noah’s sin but in Joshua 7, Achan’s family was stoned for doing that very thing. This raises the question—should we expose the sin of others? When Jesus’ disciples argued over which is the greatest, He answered by washing their feet in John 13. This shows us that we can only “uncover the nakedness” of one another’s sin if we are willing to get on our knees. First we need to deal with our own faults and then see how we can help others. The wrong way of dealing with other people’s problems is condemning them. The right way of handling problems is by approaching the matter with a humble and helpful attitude.
18:21 People sacrificed children to the god Molech.
18:22 Homosexuality is an abomination to God. The churches that are affirming and accepting this behavior are false churches that are now becoming more active. We should love homosexuals by not being mean to them but inviting them to the true church and spreading the message of the gospel not in a hateful manner.
Leviticus chapter 19
This chapter repeats the ten commandments and goes in depth explaining them. By keeping the commandments, we become holier and more like God. The whole Christian life is seeking holiness and maintaining a closer relationship to God. A deeper explanation of each commandment is provided in the commentary in Exodus chapter 20.
19:4 Making God for ourselves for the sake of worshiping it is a sin, however, having statues of Christian figures such as saints or Jesus for the sake of reminding us of the real person is not a sin if we don’t worship the statues.
19:15 A righteous judgment to our neighbor would be telling them to repent of their sins and turn away from them. We shouldn’t say that they are going to hell because of what they did because they could later repent and trust in God. Only God is the true judge.
19:17 Jesus teaches how we should act when our brother’s sin against us “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.” (Matthew 18:15). Even if our brother doesn’t listen to us, we shouldn’t hate him, instead, we should pray from him.
19:18 We see the second part of the greatest commandment here “Love your neighbor as yourself”. This is an essential teaching which Jesus emphasizes in the New Testament along with loving God with all our heart, soul and mind (Matthew 19:19, Luke 10:27.
Is getting tattoos a sin?
In verse 28 God prohibits any tattoos or cuts on your body for the dead. God had to create this commandment because of pagan practices. Pagans used to cut themselves for the dead as an act of worship to false gods. God wanted Israel to be different and only worship one God which is why He prohibited getting tattoos.
The question is if getting tattoos today is a sin? Since God provided this commandment for the sake of not worshiping other God’s, our intention of getting tattoos matters. As long as the tattoos do not promote profanity, other gods and goddesses, nor are meant for worshipping the devil and are not for evil intent, then getting tattoos aren’t sinful. God wants us to do all things for His name whether it would be eating or drinking or getting tattoos “So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31). Are intentions have to be pleasing to God.
Leviticus chapter 20
In this chapter God repeats some of the laws He has given to the nation of Israel. The consequences of breaking these laws, that are part of the Ten Commandments, were severe. People would have been put to death. This harsh consequence emphasizes that no matter what you do, you can’t break these laws because you are a nation that God has chosen, so you must walk in holiness.
20:6-8 God forbids talking to the dead and familiar spirits. Does this mean we can’t ask for intercession of the saints? Saints are people that are taken into heaven and are not considered dead because they believed in the word of Jesus and are perfected in heaven “Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.” (John 8:51). This commandment forbids talking to demonic spirits or psychics for guidance, revelation or worship.
Leviticus chapter 21
Priests are required to have greater holiness and stricter obedience to God because God has chosen them to work for Him. Ordained priest today are also expected to have a stricter obedience to God than a normal person because a priest devotes his entire life for God. However, the more we walk with God, the more we should strive to please Him and walk in more holiness. Note that our works are not what saves us, only God alone saves us through His grace, however, real and genuine faith must be shown by our works and constant walk with the Lord thought our entire lives.
In this chapter we see that priests are allowed to marry women but they have to be godly. In the Catholic church, priest are not allowed to marry, because it is better for them to put all of their focus on serving God than trying to on top of that to sustain a family. A priests life requires a large amount of dedication to work for God. Paul talks about this and says that it is better to stay unmarried so that our focus wouldn’t be all over the place.
Leviticus chapter 22
22:3 Being cut off from the presence of God in this verse means being removed from the ministry. Sin creates separation from the ability to minister. When we are in sin we need to get right with God first before we can continue walking further with Him. Active repentance is necessary in every Christian’s life. Just because Christ paid for all of our sins doesn’t mean that we ask for forgiveness once. We fall short of the glory of God everyday and need to repent. Before we receive the Eucharist, we must be right with God and free from mortal sin (CCC 1098, 1133)
22:4 Our ability to be able to eat from the word will be hindered if we are unclean. God emphasizes the importance of being clean.
22:22-25 Our eyes should not be blind nor disabled, nor full of sin, nor foreign from Jesus. We should walk with the Lord every day and be familiar with His teachings.
Leviticus chapter 23
This chapter focuses on special feast days, a liturgical calendar for Israel. The Sabbath had to be celebrated weekly. That is why going to Church on a weekly basis is essential to every Christian’s life. The Sabbath is Jesus because we find rest in Him “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28). All of the feast days were a celebration of God’s work, not our own work. God accomplishes everything Himself through the entire Bible, we are invited to believe in what He has done and trust in Him.
The Passover was a holiday celebrates God’s deliverance. God freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.
Unleavened Bread festival celebrates the exodus from Egypt. It is a reminder that people of Isreal entered a new way of living.
First Harvest festival celebrates the first crops of the barley harvest. It is a reminder of how God provides for His people.
Pentecost festival celebrates the end of the barley harvest and beginning of the wheat harvest.
The festival of Trumpets celebrates the new civil year. It is a reminder to express joy and be thankful to God.
The Day of Atonement celebrates the removal of sin from people and the nation. It is a reminder that God wants us to return to Him and He will make us righteous if we trust in Him.
The fest of Shelters celebrates God’s protection and guidance in the wilderness. It is a reminder that God will protect us and guides us, He wants us to walk with Him through our entire life.
Leviticus chapter 24
The lamp had to be shining the entire day because it is a reminder that God’s presence is always with us. He always takes care of us even when we don’t realize it. In churches and chapels where the Blessed Sacrament is reserved, a sanctuary lamp burns to indicate the Real Presence of Christ in the tabernacle.
The cost of blasphemy against God
Blasphemy against God was punishable by death which was the same consequence for murder. This shows that disrespecting the Holy name of God we are committing murder. In a way we are killing ourselves by blaspheming God because God will not die but we will. Whenever the name of our God who is transcendent, holy, perfect, full of mercy, gracious, benevolent, kind, and good is profaned, blasphemed, trivialized, His reputation is slaughtered. Unfortunately, blasphemy against God today has become very frequent and common. Most people blaspheme God’s name without realizing it—they use it as a cuss word. It is essential to stop this practice because, instead of praising God for everything He has done and all of His creation, we are cursing Him and act as gods ourselves. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is the only sin in the New Testament that is unforgivable “And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.” (Matthew 12:32). A life of rejecting God and not repenting will lead many people to eternal doom. This commandment in the New Testament is different than cursing God because here it refers to a continuing rejection and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Even if we did curse God or blaspheme Him, we can still repent and the time to do so is now. God will forgive us if our repentance is genuine. But this is not an excuse to continue disrespecting God. So let’s take the commandment of blasphemy very seriously. “If we compare murder and blasphemy as regards the objects of those sins, it is clear that blasphemy, which is a sin committed directly against God, is more grave than murder, which is a sin against one's neighbor. On the other hand, if we compare them in respect of the harm wrought by them, murder is the graver sin, for murder does more harm to one's neighbor, than blasphemy does to God. Since, however, the gravity of a sin depends on the intention of the evil will, rather than on the effect of the deed, it follows that, as the blasphemer intends to do harm to God's honor, absolutely speaking, he sins more grievously that the murderer. Nevertheless murder takes precedence, as to punishment, among sins committed against our neighbor.” (St. Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologiae, II-II, Q.13)
24:19-23 This passage seeks to bring justice and restraint. It doesn’t say if someone knocks your tooth out you should burn their house. Instead, it says a tooth for a tooth, an eye for and eye.
24:22 The same commandants apply not only to Israelites but to the “aliens”. The same commandments apply not only to Christians but to atheist and other non-Christians. Whether you believe in God or not that will not change reality. All people will be judged according to the law except if they believe in Jesus and His work on the cross. Then that will be counted as righteousness.
Leviticus chapter 25
In this chapter, God provides instructions on how to celebrate the jubilee year, emphasizing the importance of obedience to His commands. The jubilee is a year of rest and freedom as during this year, slaves were freed. Our Jubilee is Jesus because He not only brings us rest but sets us free from sin and temptation.
Verse 18 reminds us that if we follow His laws, we will live safely. This is a profound promise—God assures us that His protection and provision are guaranteed when we walk in faith and obedience. He promises that there will be enough for us, even in times of rest like the jubilee year, where no planting or harvesting occurs. Trusting Him means believing that His plan will never fail.
But how often do we truly trust God? Doubt can creep into our hearts, especially during uncertain times. Yet, we must remember that God’s Word is always true—He cannot lie (Titus 1:2). Doubts arise from our sinful hearts and the enemy. Trust in the Lord is an act of surrender, acknowledging that His ways and thoughts are higher than ours (Isaiah 55:8-9).
Just like the Israelites were called to trust God by relying on that He will provide for them, we are called to trust Him with our needs and lives, knowing that He is faithful to His word. Trusting God is not just about believing in His power but also resting in His love and timing. Trusting God means letting go of the need to control outcomes. God sees the bigger picture and has a perfect plan.
25:14-17 The closer the jubilee year was, the cheaper the property. In the same way, the closer the kingdom is, the less valuable the earthy possessions. Caring more about earthly possessions and earthy things today shows that I don’t value the godly kingdom as much as my own pleasures. Jesus is calling today to let go of any things or possession that is holding you back. Wouldn’t you want to know what He has to say about heaven and the things He has promised?
25:35-38 God orders us to treat poor family members with love and care. We have to provide for them because part of the greatest commandment is to love our neighbor as ourselves. In the same way, Jesus provides for us. He pays our debt of sin; without Him no one would be able to obtain everlasting life.
25:39-43 God commands the Israelites to free slaves on the jubilee year. Those slaves will not be sold and will not be treated poorly. Since having slaves at that time was normal, God is providing a set of rules so that they wouldn’t be treated horribly.
Leviticus chapter 26
26:1-2 God prohibits creating statues of anything that is holy or heaven if the intention is to worship that item. God alone deserves all the worship; we must not worship idols. This doesn’t mean that we can’t have statues of holy people at all because if that were the case then God would contradict Himself because in the book of exodus, He asked Moses to build two cherubim which are heavenly beings. He ordered us to keep His church holy and respectful.
26:3-9 God promises that if we keep His commandments and worship Him, He will protect us from all evil and take care of us. God wants the best for us, He doesn’t want us to suffer which is why He provides. We are called to grow in righteousness and become more holy through our lives because we love God.
26:10 God commands us to throw away the old and put on the new. The Old Testament is the old and is replaced by New Testament in which we see the newness of grace and Christ’s presence. Jesus came to fulfill the law and redeem us from our sins. God takes away the old punishment we deserve and gives it to Jesus through which we are made as new creatures and receive glory by being given the promise of entering heaven “Behold I will create a new heaven and a new earth” (Isaiah 66:22). “And he who sat on the throne said: behold, I make all things new” (Revelation 21:5). God also takes away the oldness of guilt as before we didn’t confess for our sins “Because I was silent, my bones grew old” (Psalm 31:3). This has been replaced by the newness of justice and the Holy Spirit in us revealed the truth “So we may walk in newness of life” (Rom 6:4).
26:11-12 God reassures that He will always be with us, and He will aways be our God and we will always be His children no matter what. Our hearts may deceive us, our feelings may say otherwise but remember that the Word of God cannot lie. God is not a feeling. So, if you think that God doesn’t love you or that He is far from you, remember that those are all lies from the enemy who is trying to distract you. We have to have confidence in the Lord and the way we build that is by being disciplined and spending time with Him daily.
26:14-46 God warns the people of Israel that if they do not obey Him, He will get His revenge and there will be punishment and evil in the land. These specific punishments were only for the people of Isreal as they had to strictly follow God’s orders because God chose them for His plan of salvation. Today if we sin usually nothing bad happens to us, however, if we live our lives ignoring the Lord and not believing in Jesus and His sacrifice, then the Lord will get His revenge, and we will be thrown into the lake of fire where we will burn for all eternity. Don’t make this mistake as it will have eternal consequences that you will regret. God's merciful love endures forever, and He stands always ready to forgive and reconcile his Chosen People whenever they repented of their transgressions. Even if we’re in the land of the enemy, God still cares about us. If we confess our sin to Him, if we call upon His name, He’ll restore us once again.
Leviticus chapter 27
If you make a vow to the Lord, then you have to keep it. If you didn’t keep it, then you had to pay the redemption price of the vow. Women are charged less for the vow because at that time in the culture the male had a higher earning potential than the female.
