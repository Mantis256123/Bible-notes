The book of Exodus
Introduction:
Exodus is the second book of the Torah and is often considered the "Gospel" of the Old Testament because it presents the "good news" of God's deliverance. The events described in this book are estimated to have occurred approximately 1350–1200 years before Christ and about 400 after the events of Genesis.
•	The first 12 chapters recount life under slavery in Egypt.
•	Chapters 12–18 describe the Israelites' departure from Egypt and their journey to Mount Sinai.
•	Chapters 19–24 focus on the covenant with God at Mount Sinai.
•	Chapters 25–40 detail the construction and preparation of the Tabernacle, also known as the Tent of Meeting
The main character is Moses, who is called by God to be the leader of God’s called nation.
Exodus chapter 1
Around 400 years after the events of Genesis, God’s people are slaves in Egypt. The pharaoh at this time was brutal and was scared that the Israelites will become stronger that Egyptians, so he orders to kill all the babies who are male. However, the women are fearful of God and do not listen to pharaoh. As a reward, God blesses the women with a big family. Not even pharaoh and his evil could stop God’s promise. This is a reminded that God is always with us and always listens to us in our suffering. Nothing is going to stop him from saving the world, the cross remains here to this day even after all the terrible things that have happened. History continues to repeat it self with all the evil but God’s word stays relevant.
Exodus chapter 2
Moses was born into the tribe of Levi. The events in this chapter progress quickly—moving from Moses' birth to his upbringing and eventual escape from Egypt. The author seems eager to focus on the central themes and messages of the book.
Just as God saved Noah from the Flood through the Ark, He preserved Moses from the waters of the Nile using a basket. Moses emerges as a protector of his people, though his actions include using force—such as when he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave. When Pharaoh discovered this, he sought to kill Moses, forcing him to flee.
This conflict highlights a timeless issue: the challenges between different cultures. Even today, people often struggle to understand or respect other cultures, making it difficult to foster mutual love and acceptance. It’s important to recognize that we cannot favor one perspective while ignoring or dismissing others who do things differently.
After Pharaoh's death, it was time for God to fulfill the promise He made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God's faithfulness to His promises remains evident, even if the fulfillment takes a long time. In this case, several hundred years had passed since the promise was first made.
God saw the suffering and pain of His people and acknowledged their plight (Exodus 2:25). This demonstrates that God notices and knows everything about our lives—He does not abandon us. During times of suffering, it can be difficult to remain faithful, as we may feel that God is distant or uncaring. However, this chapter reminds us that God is aware of our struggles.
While we may not always understand God's plan for us, we can trust that it is the best option. He has the power to transform our lives in ways we cannot imagine. As He was faithful to His people in the past, He will remain faithful to us as well.
Exodus chapter 3
“I will be with you”
Moses sees a burning bush that is not being burned down even though it is on fire. God warns Moses not to come closer and take his sandals because God is in the holy land. We are not worthy to approach a holy God. This is the language of the law; the law says don’t come near. It is meant to show that God is holy, he is unapproachable, he dwells in unapproachable light. This language is completely opposite to the language of the New Testament – to come near to God. James 4, 8 says “come near to God and he will come near to you.” Jesus tells us to come near his and he will give us rest. The reason why these messages are different is because Jesus is the one who made us worthy, without him, on our own, we wouldn’t be able to approach God. People who are further away from God and that have not repented in a long time sometimes feel like they are not worth praying to God and asking for forgiveness, which could lead them to continue living in a sinful lifestyle. This is a trick of the enemy; he will try to make you focus on yourself and will do everything to prevent you from returning to Christ. However, because of Jesus, God is inviting us to confess our sins and repent, he wants to be with us, we have to realize that it is only because of Jesus we can draw near Him, and he is just and kind enough to forgive our sins and make us clean again, make us clean as white wool. The suffering of our Savior is greater than your sin.
God calls Moses to save Israelites from the pain and suffering in Egypt. Moses feels like he is not good enough to save the land, but God choose him for a reason. God responds by saying that he will be by Moses side the entire time. When we are doubtful, God is by our side, God is with us, no one can be against us (Romans 8, 31). God reveals his name as YHWH – Jahveh, meaning “I am” or when referring to him “He is”. This name is not spoken because God said to call him Lord, so his name is replaced with Adonai which means Lord.
Exodus chapter 4
Moses is scared that the Israelites are not going to follow or listen to him, but God shows him miracles that will prove that this is God talking. God transforms Moses’s staff into a serpent, then Moses grabs the serpent by the tail. This is symbolical and means that God has power over Satan, this is the victory over the serpent. Being healed from leprosy is a picture of power over sin. The blood speaks of Israel redemption through the blood of Jesus, victory over sin.
Then Moses tells God that he is not a good speaker, therefore God should not choose him. God remind Moses that he is the creator of everything and has the power over our bodies. All things are possible for God.
But then Moses straight up begs for God to pick someone else. Humility is a good thing but not when it becomes disobedience and unbelief. This is just like Peter who denied Jesus 3 times – Moses also denied the plan of God 3 times. However, both came back to the Lord and followed his plan.
Moses starts trusting God and goes to save the Israelites. He says what God told him to say and does the miracles God showed him and successfully convinces the nation of Israel to follow him.
God says that pharaoh will refuse to let the nation go. Because of this the Lord will kill Pharaoh’s firstborn son (Exodus 4, 22-23). 
Exodus chapter 5
When things go bad
Moses and Aaron try to convince pharaoh that their God has told them to go to the desert to make an offering. However, pharaoh thinks of himself as a God and the one who controls other people. He thinks that the slaves have too much time on their hands and should be given more work so that they won’t come up with these ideas. Things get a lot worse for the slaves. Moses doubts God and is angry that things didn’t go as expected. The problem is that there was an expectation. When we do things, we have an expectation of how they will work out, we want some kind of reward. Whenever things don’t work out and keep getting worse, that is when we start to doubt God and get angry with him. Our faith can get weaker, and we are disappointed with God. We have to let go of our expectations because we are not God of our life, God is the one that will be making the decision. And sometimes when things go bad, it is the test of our faith to see if we will continue to be obedient to God despite our struggles. Jesus said to do things without expecting a reward, so when there is an expectation that is not fulfilled, that is when most people fall. In these moments it is revealed if we truly love God for what he is and will continue to worship him or are we going to give up on him and forget that he gave us a free gift on the cross that we don’t deserve?
Exodus chapter 6
Don’t trust your thoughts
God promises that he will make pharaoh set the slaves free from Egypt. He also says that He has not yet revealed himself to the nation of Israel as the Lord (Exodus 6, 3) but soon they will know him. God tells Moses to repeat what he slayed to the nation of Israel and Moses does, but it does not work. The God tells Moses to tell pharaoh again to set the nation free, but Moses doubts once again and thinks it won’t work (Exodus 6, 12; 6, 30). This is a situation of who is right – is it God who commands us or are we the ones that are right? During the wedding in Caanan, when Jesus turned water into vine, he said that the water is vine even though it looked like water, tasted like water. But when Jesus talks, he is the one that is telling the truth, we have to deny our thoughts even when things don’t make sense. So whatever God tells you what to do, he knows better that you – he is correct because he is perfect, no mistakes can happen. We have to learn to trust him with everything in our lives, he will make our paths straight.
Exodus chapter 7
God assigns Aaron as the prophet which means a person who can legitimately speak for God and in God’s name to others.
Because Pharaoh did not let the Israelites go, God sent a series of ten disasters known as the “ten plagues of Egypt”. These disasters occur on Moses’ commands and are meant to convince Pharaoh that the God of the Hebrews is truly speaking to them.
Firstly, Aaron threw his staff, and it turned into a serpent, then Aaron struck the waters with the staff and turned the waters of Nile into blood.
Interestingly, Egyptian magicians did the same things as Aaron did (Exodus 7, 22). Does this mean that magic exists? Well, this phrase is exaggerated because when Aaron turned all the water of Nile into blood then that means that there should be no water left, meaning there was no water for the magicians to “do the same” with. But this magical recreation of the disasters and magic could be real, but they are not from God. Satan has power and he too can-do magical things but they are false – the works of the enemy.
Since Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he refuses to believe that God is actually speaking and is real. For a lot of people, it is the same – they need to see many miracles or specific miracles and only then they will believe in God. There is already so much evidence that God exists, besides that God will not show us everything right now because he wants us to have faith in him that is genuine meaning trusting and believing in him when we don’t understand him. Faith cannot be forced, God gave us free will to willingly choose him and we must decide on our own if we believe in him.	
Is God just for hardening Pharaoh’s heart? Does that mean God took Pharoah’s free will?
A lot of thins in the Bible are difficult to understand, however reading the Word we can find that God’s actions are always just and there are not mistakes: “The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is he.” (Deuteronomy 32, 3-4). We have to make the decision if we believe in the Bible without fully understanding it. God’s thoughts are not our thoughts, and his ways are not our ways.
Pharoah did have free will however he refused to repent over a long period of time, he was “given over” as described in Romans 1. Pharaoh has lived a life of arrogance and hardened his heart and now he has been given over to what he wanted in the first place.
Exodus chapter 8
Moses and Aaron continue to do disasters across Egypt such as summoning frogs, gnats, flies. This time when the magicians try to produce gnats with their magic, they couldn’t do it. It was the finger of God at work which illustrates that a power greater then their own is at work. Satan’s power is not superior to God’s power but is significantly weaker.
During the plagues Pharoah asked Moses and Aaron to pray for him so remove the plagues (Exodus 8, 4). However, after the plagues were removed, Pharoah still hardened his heart and refuse to let the Israelites go. This is an example of a person who only prays or asks for prayed to get something for themselves. After they receive the thing, they prayed for, that is when they abandon their faith and forget about God. That is not what a real disciple of Jesus does, we have to commit to God for the rest of our lives.
Exodus chapter 9
Pharaoh still keeps hardening his heart and ignores God even though God says that the plagues will keep getting worse. In verse 15 God is saying that he could have struck Pharaoh in an instant and didn’t have to give him all these opportunities to change. But God is faithful and will give us opportunities to change, it is not too late to turn to him if we are here on Earth. Only because of the grace of God we are still alive today. If we got what we deserve based on our obedience and lack of faith, then we would already be dead. When God speaks, we need to obey, listen to his Word carefully. Our goal should be to get daily bread from God which means his word – constantly grow in our faith.
Exodus chapter 10
God reveals that he continues to harden Pharoah’s heart and perform miracles so that the future generations would believe in him and that he is the one true God.
In verse 11 Pharoah realized that if the men went alone then they would have needed to return to their families. He suspected that the Hebrews has no intention of returning back to Egypt and would leave for good.
In verse 16 Pharoah repents and admits that he has sinned, however he does not turn away from sin and continues to harden his heart. This type of repentance where you don’t turn away from sin can be called false repentance and was the same as Judas repentance. Just because someone admits that they have sinned doesn’t mean that they have repented. To repent means to change, elevate your mind, move your mind closer to God. True repentance is when you feel guilty for your sin and turn away from it.
In verse 24 Pharoah tries to make a compromise with Moses, however, Moses responds by saying that no animal will be left behind. This is similar to what Jesus teaches in the parable where one sheep gets lost, and the Shepard goes out looking for it – no sheep will be lost. Pharoah’s compromises are happening in current world – people try to justify sins like cursing, adultery, homosexuality because that is what others are doing. We make compromises that fit our lives and forget about what the Word of God says. This is a dangerous thing that can harden our own heart because we start getting used to the same sin, it becomes normal for us. Think about the compromises in your life that hinder your relationship with Jesus. Can you find a solution to it? 
Exodus chapter 11
Moses warns Pharoah that the there will be a plague in which every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die. This plague will happen to animals and firstborns. This warning was first mentioned in Exodus chapter 4, 23: “I will kill your son, your firstborn”, but will only be executed now. It would have been avoided if Pharoah would have listened, but God knew that he wouldn’t. We see that God is slow to wrath and saved the killing of the firstborn as the last plague, showing that human life is precious to Him as he gave multiple chances. God gives us many chances and opportunities – our entire life we can choose to believe and follow him or reject him. While we are here on Earth it is not too late to get close to God, however, we could die at any moment and Jesus can come back at any moment, thus we shouldn’t put God off until later in life but start trusting him now.
Exodus chapter 12
The first 20 verses are God’s instructions on how to celebrate the Passover, the freedom from slavery from Egypt. This event is so significant that God creates a brand-new calendar for Israel. In verse 2” This month” occurred around March-April. The exodus from slavery in Egypt marks the beginning of Israel life as an independent nation.
The lamb in the Old Testament is a sign of celebration of the freedom from Egypt and is a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament Jesus is referred to as the lamb meaning he is our celebration of freedom from slavery to sin. The lamb’s having to be without defect which foreshadows the sinlessness of Christ. The paschal lamb was killed, not to be looked upon only, but to be fed upon; so we must by faith make Christ ours, as we do that which we eat, and we must receive spiritual strength and nourishment from him, as from our food, and have delight and satisfaction in him, as we have in eating and drinking when we are hungry or thirsty (John 6, 53-55). The people have to eat the lamb with the bitter herbs which represent the bitter life of slavery in Egypt. We must feed upon Christ with sorrow and brokenness of heart, in remembrance of sin; this will give an admirable relish to the paschal lamb. Bread without yeast signifies absence of sin and the coming of the sinless savior Jesus who will save the world. We must feast on the body of the lamb – the Eucharist at church, the word of the Lord to get everlasting life. In verse 16 God says that no work must be done meaning that this sacrifice is 100% God’s doing, and we just receive it, we can’t add onto the sacrifice on the cross, it is He that saved us. The Israelites sheltered under the blood of the lamb so that God would protect them from the plague. Today, we are also sheltering under the blood of Jesus that was shed on the cross which protects us from death. The Passover and the feast of the unleavened bread are referring to the same thing, the feast is mentioned in the New Testament, so this is an important thing to notice. God says that he person who eats leavened bread will be cut off (excommunicated from the Israelite community) because God wanted to make the point that the sacrifice of the lamb that will be made in the future (Jesus’s sacrifice) will be perfect, sinless.
In verse 23 God refers to the one who is doing the killing “the destroyer” which could mean that he is talking about Satan or a destroying angel.
After all the firstborns are killed, Pharoah orders the Israelites to leave Egypt. In verse 32 Pharoah as them to bless him too which is a final and humiliating admission of defeat. Pharoah asks for intersection (others to pray for him) even though he might be asking this sarcastically, Jesus taught that we should pray for our enemies.
The Lord mentions how only the ones who can have been circumcised can celebrate the Passover just like only the ones who are baptized can then start preparing to take the communion and approach the Lord’s supper. The words in verse 46: “You shall not break any of its bones” are applied to Jesus on the cross (John 19, 36) showing the perfect sacrifice for all people from the bondage of sin.
Exodus chapter 13
God leads the Israelites through the longer, tougher road instead of the shorter, easier route because he does not want them to start fighting and end up returning back to Egypt. Similarly, God often leads our spiritual life through tougher road for our own good. He does not leave us alone just like he does not leave the Israelites by providing the way by the pillar of cloud during the day and then showing the way by the pillar of fire during the night. God will not abandon us, and he will help us by his grace through the journey of life.
Exodus chapter 14
Pharoah attacking the Israelites with his army and after they find out, the people start complaining to Moses and questioning God’s authority. When things don’t go our way, we tend to get angry at God and don’t trust him. Remember that God will not abandon us, and his choice is always correct. In the end God will always make something bad into something good.
Moses, with the help from God, performs one of the most popular miracles and he divides the sea into two parts so that the nation could walk through it. After seeing this great display, Israelites started believing God and Moses once again. This passage can be seen a symbol for baptism – we enter the water where the power of sin is destroyed, and we arise new creations that believe in the Lord.


Exodus chapter 15
To celebrate the victory against Pharoah, the Israelites started singing and praising God. However, after not finding anything to drink for three days, they started complaining again. The Lord promises that obedience to Him will prevent the people from getting ill. This is not just in a physical sense but in a spiritual sense – being obedient to God will heal us from the sickness of the broken world. This promise might not be true to us currently as the covenant we have currently does not have anything physical promised but our covenant, the one Jesus promised, is far greater than the covenant Moses had. 
Exodus chapter 16
16, 1-3: After entering the desert, the Israelites start complaining/grumbling against God and say that it would have been better for them to eat a lot of food and die rather than to suffer in the desert from starvation. The more pleasing and easier alternative always seems like the best decision to us. When we make choices, we often start regretting them and start thinking about how the easier choice we didn’t make would have been better. But if we made that decision and talked to God about it then his ways will be correct. His ways are often much harder, but the reward waiting is better than the short pleasures we could have had. Grumbling is the act of showing lack of faith in God. Grumbling against some else is grumbling against God.
Later God sent bread from the heaven called manna to the people of Israel to eat. Although the bread was from the heavens, it did not bring the Israelites to their heavenly destiny. Manna was a temporary food that melted away every morning and started turning foul if it was left overnight. This manna was an early sign of the bread that is to come. Manna can be regarded as a type of Eucharist from the early days. Jesus talks about his bread in John 6, 32; 49-52 saying that the ancestors ate manna at the desert and died but Jesus is here to give us bread that will make us live because He is the bread of life: “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes in me will never thirst.” (John 6, 35). Jesus is truly the real bread we must eat which is present In the Eucharist in the church. Following him and trusting in him will prevent us from dying because we will be resurrected on the last day. Jesus is the hope of the universe and living by his word is how we get through this life without getting hungry or thirsty for worldly things. The bread of life is both an invitation of Faith and an invitation to the Eucharist (discussed more in the commentary of John chapter 6). God sent this bread so that they would believe that he is their Lord which was proven in John 6 when Jesus revealed that he is the real heavenly bread that the world needed. Those who gathered too much manna had enough and those who gathered less manna had enough which tells us that the true bread of Jesus is sufficient enough for all of us and everyone will receive the same amount.
God provided double the bread on the sixth day so that they would have enough for the seventh because the seventh day is the Sabbath. However, some people still went looking for bread on the seventh day thus breaking God’s commandment (Exodus 16, 27).  The Law and orders from God cause our sinful nature to sin and disobey him out of our curiosity like a child who is told not to eat candy will eat the candy. The Law that we break sets us apart from God but because of the Law we can see that we desperately need a savior who can save us from our sin and that man is Jesus. The Sabbath is made for rest and currently on the seventh day we should not work hard but celebrate Sunday by going to church and spending time with the Lord.


Exodus chapter 17
God test the people of Israel by leading them to place without water. The Israelites once again grumble and complain that they are going to die of thirst – they struggle to trust God and his plan. The reason why God did not provide water is to test them. Often, He tests us in our life to see if we will keep our faith after going through difficulties in our life. The point is to trust God in our hardships because we know he will provide for us – if we seek the kingdom of God, we will not be thirsty. God provides water in the desolate place from a rock. This rock is references in Deuteronomy 32, 4 as a way of showing that God’s ways are perfect – “The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and upright is he.” (Deuteronomy 32, 4).
Jesus is the rock that brings the living water in the greatest moment of desperation – “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture had said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.’” (John 7, 37-38). This water also symbolizes the grace of the Holy Spirit, which is a new birth in the life of Christ as in the Sacrament of Baptism. (CCC 694)
Moses’ gesture of prayer during the battle against Amalekites demonstrates the importance of prayer in accomplishing God’s will. (CCC 2119)
Exodus chapter 18
After Moses talks to Jethro about all the things that happened, Jethro gives some advice for how Moses could work. We are not sure if Jethro was a man of God, but he gave some good advice to Moses which shows how God can use others that might not necessarily be believers to give us wise advice. Moses put men in charge which took care of smaller cases but the bigger cases were brought to Moses thus significantly lowering the amount of work Moses had to do. This model of Moses was a blueprint for the leadership structure of Israel.
Exodus chapter 19
God is about to show us at mount Sinai, he warns the people of Israel that they can’t go near the mountain to try to see God because they would instantly die. They had to be holy and couldn’t even touch the mountain because they would also have to die. This is because God is extremely powerful, you have to bee fully righteous to see him face to face. We do not deserve to see him because we are weak, we struggle so much with sin and our hearts are wicked, we are unrighteous to see God ourselves. But the reason why we can get close to Jesus is because he is the one who makes us righteous and allows us to get close to him – his perfect sacrifice on the cross was his paying the price for all of our sins and believing in him is what makes us step closer to holiness. Without Jesus we could never see God face to face but because of him we may live with God in heaven.
In verses 5-6 the nation of Israel is called the kingdom of priests, a holy nation, God’s treasured possession which means that they are God’s chosen people that were to listen to God’s Word, keep the covenant and his commandments. The same way Jesus talks about his people – he has purchased us with his blood, and no one can snath us away from him: “I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.” (John 10, 28)
God’s appearance at mount Sinai is one of the greatest and coolest appearances – the entire mountains was shaking, it was completely enveloped in smoke, the Lord came down upon it in fire, there was lightning and thunder. This shows the unspeakable power of God.
Exodus chapter 20
The ten commandments
God reveals the ten commandments which are called the moral law. Most laws in the Old Testament are part of the old covenant which means that we don’t need to follow them, however, the ten commandments are the law that everyone needs to follow as Jesus mentioned them through the New Testament. These commandments are based upon the Greatest commandment: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind… You shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Matthew 22, 37; 39)	. The first three Commandments relate to our obligation to God; the next seven establish our moral conduct towards our neighbor. We can’t change the law or add to it because if we break one commandment, we break the entire law. Our hope should not be in the law because we cannot keep the entire life and will not go to heaven for being a good person. Our hope should be in Jesus who gave the perfect sacrifice for our sins and in believing this truth we should strive to live a life by following the teaching of Jesus. Jesus told us to keep the commandments and try our best not to break them. By trying to keep the commandments we show God that we do love him and try our best to follow him - “If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him.” (John 14, 15-17).
1.	The First Commandment “You shall not have other gods beside me” is there to acknowledge God as our creator. If forbids superstition, idolatry, communication with the dead, witchcraft, atheism, agnosticism. Other gods can even include things we spend too much time or deeply care about on such as watching YouTube, sports, playing video games, money, food, music, luck, beauty. We can’ t test God with our words or actions. We must follow God by responding to him and finding time to spend with Him. Nothing else in our life should be higher than God which is why our lives have to be dedicated in knowing Him, serving Him, obeying Him and worshiping Him. (CCC 2110-2132)
God says to not a have any carved images of Him, however, Catholics and Orthodox have icons and statues of holy people. This is because Jesus showed up to earth as a human which we have seen meaning we now know what the image of God is: “Whoever has seen me, has seen the Father” (John 14, 9). The statues are there to remind us of an image that is holy, but we do not worship them and don’t think they have some sort of power because if we did, then that would be idolatry and breaking the first Commandment. This command does not prohibit having icons or statues but it prohibits worshiping them. This is proven because later on God orders Moses to make icons of cherubim which God honored and which are placed in the temple. (More about statues and this commandment will be discussed later) 
This command is the basis of our faith	and should influence every aspect of our lives. Sins against faith include willful doubt, heresy, schism, despair, presumption, indifference toward God, lukewarmness, spiritual sloth, hatred of God, coldness towards neighbors. (CCC 2084, 2086-2094)

2.	The Second Commandment “You shall not invoke the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” teaches that we should respect the name of God in our speech. We can’t use it as a cuss word or involve it in some bad activity. This also includes the name of Jesus, the Holy Spirit, Mary, the saints, the Church. It also requires respect for sacred objects. The sins that break this Commandment are blasphemy and perjury. We can’t swear to God’s name or curse someone in God’s name. We say “In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit” so show respect to the trinitarian God because he is holy. (CCC 2142-2155, 2156-2167)

3.	The Third Commandment “Remember the sabbath day – keep it holy” teaches that we should observe a weekly day of worship and rest because when God created the heaven and the earth, on the seventh day he rested. This commandment is fulfilled by going to Mass every Sunday and on the Holy Days of Obligation unless prevented from doing so for grave reasons. On this day we shouldn’t do any difficult tasks or unnecessary work that detaches us from worship. It is a day during which we can recover our energy and spend time with family. During the Sabbath Jesus healed others and did miracles which caused the Pharisees to question if he is the Messiah. This means that during this day we can and should do good work such as helping charity.
Christian changes the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday because Jesus resurrected on Sunday. The Christian Sunday reminds us of how the world was renewed through Christ and is a reminder of the everlasting rest in God. Missing mass without a serious reason is considered a moral sin. (CCC 2168-2196)

4.	The Fourth Commandment “Honor your father and your mother” requires us to honor our parents just as we honor those who have authority over us. We have to be grateful to our parents, respect them. Parents are obligated to educate their children in the faith and prayer. We should avoid any unnecessary arguments or yelling at our parents or showing them disrespect. When parents are sick or older, we should take care of them with love and care. Jesus said – “’Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.” (Matthew 15, 4). The greatest thing parent can do is to spread the Good News to their children and teach them about Jesus. Family is one of the most important things in life, however, God is more important and should be treated higher than family because children do not “belong” to parents and parents do not “belong” to children as they are a gift from God, but every human belongs to God – “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.” (Matthew 10, 37). Parents should be humble and should think of their job as a parent as being a servant. Jesus did not do anything from himself but only did the will of the Father. He humbled himself by becoming a human and served others by putting himself at the bottom - He even washed the feet of his apostles (John 13, 1-20). (CCC 2197-2257)

5.	The Fifth Commandment “You shall not kill” forbids taking the life of any human. Sins that violate this commandment are homicide, abortion, suicide, manipulation of human life that causes them harm. Humans don’t break this commandment if they kill others in self defense and try to save themselves from a bad situation. Everything that does harm to us and those around us is a sin. This includes drugs, drinking, driving fast.
This commandment can also be broken in a spiritual sense – hating others and refusing to forgive or wishing others bad is breaking the commandment. Jesus says – “You have heard that our ancestors were told, 'You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment. ' But I say, if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment!” (Matthew 5, 21-26). Jesus says to forgive others and turn the other cheek if they are hurting you. During the Sermon on the Mount, He says – “Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter every kind of evil against you [falsely] because of me. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven.” (Matthew 5, 11-12). (CCC 2258-2330)
6.	The Sixth Commandment “You shall not commit adultery” prohibits all sexual acts outside of marriage which include masturbation, fornication, prostitution, rape, homosexual acts, lust, use of pornography. Jesus says that just looking with lust is already breaking the Commandment. He suggests we get rid of any distractions that causes us to look with lust or sin – “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you, everyone who looks at a woman with lust had already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into Gehenna. (Matthew 5, 27-89). (CCC 2331-2400)

7.	The Seventh Commandment “You shall not steal” prohibits taking something that we don’t have the right to possess. This includes damaging property intentionally, working poorly on purpose, breaking contracts, evading taxes, cheating, spending excessively, tricking others, asking to pay too much. (CCC 2401-2463)
Instead of stealing we are called to feed the poor, comfort our neighbors, visit the sick and those in prison, teach the lost, comfort the sad, warn the evil doers, forgive others, pray for the living and the dead.

8.	The Eighth Commandment “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor” calls us to tells the truth both in word and in deed. Sins that break this commandment are lying, false witness, judgment, slander, boasting. Jesus is the ultimate truth that we need to follow through our whole life – “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14, 6). Lying destroys trust in others and is a form of manipulation. (CCC 2464-2513)

9.	The Ninth Commandment “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or female” orders us not to be covetous of another person’s spouse. This commandment involves self-control over our inordinate pleasures of the flesh. We must turn to God in prayer so that he would renew our hearts and change our wicked minds. We also can’t break our marriage covenant so we shouldn’t go looking for other women or men. (CCC 2514-2533)

10.	The Tenth Commandment “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house” orders us not to be covetous of another person’s property. This involves greed and envy. Wanting to own other’s property can lead us to steal, lie, and use violence against others. When people envy each other, they want to gain that which other earned. Those who wish bad things for others commit a grave sin. Envy reduces when we start being happy for others, their accomplishments and wins. We should love our neighbor as ourselves and the real treasure is the ability to live a life God intended. Jesus wants us to be poor in our hearts so that we would become rich in the sacrifice of Jesus and fill our void in our hearts – “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.” (2 Corinthians 8, 9). “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5, 3). (CCC 2534-2557)

In verses 23-26, God tells the Israelites to make an altar of stone and to not add anything to it. This altar is a representation of Jesus who is the perfect sacrifice meaning that if we add anything to it such as the thinking that we go to heaven based on our good works, then we are not trusting the sacrifice completely and profane it.
Exodus chapter 21
The first part of this chapter talks about slavery and how God is trying to reduce the evils of slavery by adding certain laws and a lime limit. Slavery in the Old Testament was not abusive or harsh as slavery throughout history. During the Old Testament there was a type of good slavery in which slaves loved their master and willingly wanted to live with them for the rest of their lives. The Law gave protection over slave abuse. God prepared his people for the coming of Messiah through a gradual process and he usually makes us go through a gradual process before we can reach a certain blessing in our lives. Jesus’ mission was not to eliminate every violation of human dignity but to free humanity from its slavery to sin.
In verse 24 God is saying specifically that if a pregnant woman gets hurt by a bystander and the baby gets hurt then “you shall give eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot…” which shows that a baby’s life is just as important as a regular human. This Law does not apply for every injury we face and is not a justification of revenge, but it is there to keep thing out of hand – the penalty must fit the crime. In Sermon on the Mount Jesus says that instead of giving eye for an eye we should turn the other cheek to find a deeper form of justice.
Exodus chapter 22
God provides more Laws for the people of Israel to function better in the world. Some conflicts were resolved by approaching the local sanctuary to take an oath before God (Exodus 22, 7-9). God is very serious how he wants people treat others and warn those who treat others badly, that God will have his revenge. We see that God is a God of justice and he does not let sin go unpunished.
Exodus chapter 23
23: 1-9 God talks about keeping the truth to avoid evil and to help enemies. This was society were vengeance was common so God taught the people to be kind to their enemies – “When you come upon your enemy’s ox or donkey going astray, you must see to it that it is returned.” (Exodus 23, 4). “When you notice the donkey of one who hates you lying down under its burden, you should not desert him; you must help him with it” (Exodus 23, 5). These new Laws should still be present today – when we see something bad happening to others, we should try to help them, call the police, ambulance and don’t just ignore them because that would be considered a sin and ignoring them might be the reason they could die. These verses show the signs of Jesus who in the New Testament taught to love your enemies - “But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you” (Matthew 5:43–44). In verse 9 God tells the people to not hurt aliens (those who are not for the area). Today we should comfort those who are clueless and not part of any groups or struggle to make friends.
23: 20-23 God is sending an angel by our side that will take us to the place that the Father has prepared. This is referring to Jesus as he says – “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also.” (John 14, 3). Also we are guarded by our guardian angels that protect our lives.
23: 28-30 God says that he will drive out Hivites, Canaanites and Hittites little by little and in one years instead of immediately. God often walks us through problems and situations little by little so that we may learn. He doesn’t take away our problems instantly because without suffering there wouldn’t be as much appreciation.
Exodus chapter 24
Atonement for sins
Moses builds an altar and then splashes the blood of the offering saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which the Lord has made with you according to all these words.” (Exodus 24, 8). In the New Testament during the Last Supper, Jesus says similar words regarding the new Covenant that we are a part of – “For this is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins.” (Matthew 26, 28). The reason why there is blood involved is because of sin that involves death meaning that there would need to be a blood substitute in order to atone for sins. Animals were substitute for the atonement of sins for people in the Old Testament. When the blood was sprinkled upon the altar, it symbolized the offering of the people's lives to God—a life that had symbolically passed through death and was sanctified by His grace. The sprinkling of blood upon the people represented the restoration of life, now renewed by God's grace. However, this was only a temporary solution and required continual repetition, as these sacrifices could not permanently atone for sin. In the New Testament, Jesus’ perfect sacrifice on the cross fulfilled this need once and for all. His atoning death covers all sins—past, present, and future—eliminating the need for repeated sacrifices. This ultimate sacrifice highlights why humanity needed a Messiah: to bear the wrath of God in our place and provide a final, perfect atonement for sin. As the author of Hebrews explains: “And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God…For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.” (Hebrews 10:11-12, 14).
Additionally, Moses spent forty days and forty nights on Mount Sinai (Exodus 24:18), a period mirrored in the New Testament when Jesus fasted in the wilderness and faced temptation (Matthew 4:2; Luke 4:2). The number forty holds deep biblical significance. Israel wandered in the desert for forty years as part of their spiritual testing and growth (Deuteronomy 8:2). Similarly, after traveling for forty days, Elijah was sustained and strengthened by food provided by an angel (1 Kings 19:8). This number symbolizes periods of testing, spiritual trial, and ultimately, the strengthening of faith through God’s miraculous provision.
Exodus chapter 25
God gives Moses precise instructions on how to build the temple. In verses18-20 God says to build two Cherubim which are in the form of human headed winged lions who formed the throne for the invisible Lord. These creatures are from heaven and yet God asks Moses to build an image of them on Earth which would be a contradiction to the First Commandment when God says that “You shall not make for yourself an idol or a likeness of anything in the heavens above or on the earth below or in the water beneath the earth” (Exodus 20, 4). If God ordered Moses to build an image of something that is in heaven, then that means that we can have images of things from heaven and in order not to break the First Commandment, we should not worship the image and make it an idol. The images are encouraged by God to be a reminder of him and strengthening faith in him. The tablets containing the Law, stored in the Ark of the Covenant, represented the entirety of the covenant between God and Israel, agreed upon at Mount Sinai. The Mercy Seat, located in the Holy of Holies, was the central feature of the Tabernacle. It symbolized God's throne on Earth and was a powerful reminder of His enduring mercy and presence. The Tabernacle itself was to be built with utmost care and precision because God’s dwelling place had to reflect His majesty, holiness, and perfection.
Ultimately, the Tabernacle was more than just a physical structure or a set of rules; it was a prophetic symbol of God's plan for redemption. It foreshadowed the coming of Jesus Christ, who would fulfill God’s promise to dwell among His people and provide eternal mercy and salvation.
Exodus chapter 26
Exodus 26 provides detailed instructions for constructing the Tabernacle, the sacred dwelling place of God among His people during their time in the wilderness. The chapter emphasizes the precise materials, dimensions, and design of the Tabernacle, highlighting its significance as a reflection of God's holiness, order, and desire to dwell with His people.
The use of blue, purple, and scarlet fabrics carries symbolic meaning. Blue often represents divinity and heaven, reminding the Israelites of God's transcendence. Purple, a color associated with royalty, signifies God's sovereignty and majesty. Scarlet symbolizes the blood sacrifice necessary for atonement, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ for the forgiveness of sins. Together, these colors reflect God's divine plan for redemption through Jesus Christ, the King and Savior.
The curtains and coverings served to separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, underscoring the holiness of God and the need for mediation between Him and humanity. This separation was ultimately bridged by Christ, whose death tore the veil in the Temple (Matthew 27:51), granting believers direct access to God.
The Tabernacle itself symbolizes Christ, who is described as the dwelling place of God among men (John 1:14: “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us”). Each element of the Tabernacle—its structure, materials, and purpose—foreshadows aspects of Christ's work and identity. The Tabernacle was temporary, meant for the Israelites’ journey, just as Christ’s earthly ministry was a temporary part of God's eternal plan for humanity's salvation.
Exodus chapter 27
The altar described in Exodus 27 had "horns" on its four corners, a feature that has been corroborated by archaeological findings. Four-horned altars have been uncovered throughout ancient Israel, particularly at Beersheba and Arad. According to Amos 3:14, one manifestation of divine judgment is that God will cut off the horns of the altar, causing them to fall to the ground. All of these precise measurements and details show how much thought and work God puts into his creation. Interestingly, Jesus' earthly profession as a carpenter further aligns with this divine focus on craftsmanship and creation. As the Son of God, He was not only a spiritual builder of the Kingdom but also a physical creator, showcasing His role in both the material and spiritual realms.
Exodus chapter 28
The priestly garments that Aaron and his sons had to wear were made for God’s beauty and his glory. In all these passages, what is brought or presented to the Lord apparently is for the benefit of the Lord’s remembrance. These items or gifts or sounds serve as reminders to God, just as he said the rainbow after the flood would be a reminder to him (Genesis 9:14–15).
Exodus chapter 29
In verses 31-34 God says to biol the meat of the Lamb and eat it with bread. God says that what is left after they eat needs to be burned in a fire because it is holy. This tells us that some items on earth can be and are holy and hold significance. There are stories today that from statues and relics, that represent a holy person, miracles happen. In verse 37, just touching the altar will make you holy. God can choose to make certain items holy and show his healing power through them. So having statues of people like the Saints and Jesus is not necessarily idolatrous but can be a blessing. God wants to be next to us the entire time and we get that stronger connection by being in his church. His presence is truly there, especially in the Eucharist, and he is our one and only God. The priests are an essential part of the church that dedicate their lives to serve the Lord. Today we should pray for them as well as the nuns and everyone dedicating their lives to God.
Exodus chapter 30
In Exodus chapter 30, God commands Moses to make special anointing oil and incense, both of which are to be used exclusively for sacred purposes. God explicitly warns the people not to replicate these holy items for personal use. Anyone who disobeys this command would be cut off from His people, emphasizing the sacredness of what is dedicated to God. This passage invites us to reflect on our own lives. Are there things we take or do for ourselves that should be dedicated to God? For instance, when we accomplish something good through the power of the Holy Spirit, do we forget that God is the one working in and through us and instead take the credit for ourselves? Or do we sometimes attend church out of obligation rather than a genuine desire to honor and remember Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross? This chapter reminds us to live in a way that is pleasing to God and to give Him the glory for all that He does in our lives. Everything we do should be an act of worship, acknowledging that He is the one who transforms and works through us. Our faith should be genuine and not an imitation of others.
Exodus chapter 31
The chapter starts of by listing the works God wants the people of Israel to do and is a summary of what he has said in the last few chapters. After that, God reminds his people that we should rest on the Sabbath. He emphasizes that there needs to be a day dedicated to God and is holy. If the people did not keep the Sabbath and disrespected it, they would have been put to death. This shows how serious a command this is and could be the reason why today missing Mass on Sunday without any good excuse is considered a grave sin as it demonstrates a lack of reverence for God and His command to keep the day holy.
Exodus chapter 32
Power of prayer
The people of Israel get tired of waiting for Moses and decide to create a false God, a golden calf that they worship. They break the First Commandment by worshiping an idol and taking his name in vain – “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord” (Exodus 32, 5). This can represent us as when we are waiting for something either a blessing or opportunity, we get impatient and take things into our own hands instead of waiting for God’s answer. We make a God for ourselves and it starts becoming our idol.
God gets so mad that he plans to kill all of the people and start a new nation from Moses. However, Moses prays that God would change his mind. The question is why did God change his mind, shouldn’t he be never changing and know the future that will happen? The reason why God changes his mind could be because Moses interceded for the people of Israel before God and because of this God heard his prayed and showed his divine mercy. A prayer can change everything for us. God hears us and this chapter could be an indicator that we should constantly pray about things in our lives and let them know to God and maybe he will change our future, make our paths straight, show his mercy. However, not all of our prayers will be answered if they are not correct – empty, without faith or wishing for the wrong things. In Exodus chapter 3:5 we can see that God does not answer Moses prayer which was “Sent someone else” but here God accept his prayer because Moses asks God to show mercy and feels bad for the nation. He is a God who listens to our prayers, takes what we have to say seriously, and often adjusts his intentions. This has also been seen once before in Genesis chapter 18, when Abraham asked God to not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah if he finds 10 righteous people instead of 50. This indicates that our prayer for others can be influential in changing God’s desired plan and is a way of asking God to show his divine love and mercy for us. Let’s pray for each other because our prayer will be answered with the right intentions.
Exodus chapter 33
33:1-11 The sin of God’s people set them further away from God. The Lord warned them that if he were to walk with them, he would most likely destroy them (Exodus 33:3). They could worship God but from a distance (Exodus 33:10). Sin separates us from God, that is why repentance is crucial to turn back to Him. Repentance means to turn away from sin, change your mind so that you can please God.
33:12-23 God maintained a closer relationship with Moses as He was pleased with him. God spoke to Moses “face to face” meaning that He directly spoke to Moses not through a dream or vision, or prophet. The phrase does not mean that Moses literally saw God because if a person sees the Lord, they die. Moses asked God to reveal His glory. God allowed Moses to see His back but not His face. This shows that we can know God and his character, but we will never be able to fully see Him and His greatness. In verse 19 God says that he will show mercy to those who he chooses and will show compassion to those who he chooses. This shows that He is the ultimate judge, and we shouldn’t think that we deserve anything from Him because we don’t. We should abuse his grace by willfully sinning and thinking that God will just forgive us because he chooses who he will forgive and if we are not genuine and don’t seek forgiveness then He might not forgive us. This is elaborated in Romans 9:10-18 which says that we don’t choose of work for God’s mercy because He chooses who He wants to forgive.
Exodus chapter 34
God reveals His character and His glory to Moses. We see the main attributes of God and who He is – God is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, abounding in love, forgiving wickedness, rebellion, and sin but being a fair judge by not declaring the guilty guiltless (Exodus 34:6-7). Everything the Lord says autobiographically is something that God is or does for the benefit of others, especially his chosen people. Mercy toward Israel is independent of their responding in the right way. Even when Israel is disobedient it is still the recipient of the divine goodness. We need to be thankful for who God is and how great His attributes are because otherwise we wouldn’t be here today. God renews His Covenant with the nation and reminds Moses the rules that he had listed before. The Covenant that God is making is not a permanent Covenant and will later be changes into the Covenant we have today – “In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.” (Hebrews 8:13). God warns the people of Israel to not make a covenant with the people of the land they are about to inherit. Today we have the covenant with our Lord Jesus and have been purchased by his blood, thus, we should avoid making a covenant with the world and its darkness.
Exodus chapter 35
In this chapter, Moses requests the people of Israel to start preparing to build the tabernacle. We see that most people bring what they have and offer generously. It shows that having a willing heart is essential when it comes to serving God. God calls us to give what we can to others, especially to the poor. As Paul says, “Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver” (2 Corinthians. 9:7). Just as the Israelites were not forced to contribute but did so out of love and obedience, we are also invited to serve God voluntarily, with gratitude and joy.
Dear Lord, Thank You for the blessings You have given me. Help me to listen to Your voice and make wise decisions through the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Give me a generous and willing heart to share what I have with others, so that I may reflect Your love and kindness in all I do. Teach me to give freely and joyfully, knowing that everything I have comes from You. May my actions bring glory to You and help those in need. Amen.
Exodus chapter 36
In this chapter people give more than there is needed for the construction of the tabernacle. It is a reminder that God gives us more than enough. The abundance of resources given by the Israelites reflects God's provision and their obedience. When God's people respond to Him with obedience and trust, He ensures that they have what they need to accomplish His plans. We shouldn’t worry about not having enough of something because God hears us and he provides – “Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” (Matthew 6:31-33).
Exodus chapter 37
The people of Israel continue to build the tabernacle providing every detail of their work. All of these details are here for a reason and they most likely are a resemblance of heaven. When we go to heaven, we will understand what all of these things meant.
Exodus chapter 38
The Israelites build the altar maliciously following every instruction that God provided. God provides instructions in our life as well. As believers, we have to put our faith in Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice for our sins and follow his teachings.
Exodus chapter 39
39:1 In this chapter the Israelites make the holy garments and priest clothes. The color blue represents heaven, the color purple represents royalty and scarlet represents the blood. These colors are a part of the holy garments meaning that these garments are pointing to Jesus. Jesus came down from heaven and took the form of the flesh and became blood. When we mix blue and red we get purple. Jesus who was 100% God and 100% man makes royalty, a kingship. By shedding His blood on the cross, our sins, who were red as scarlet, become white as wool.
The high priest of the Old Testament is Aaron which foreshadows the ultimate high priest in the New Testament which is Jesus – “Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.” (Hebrews 4:14). High priests were the ones that made intersession for the people of Israel just like now Jesus is the mediator between man and God and he is the one that makes our prayers acceptable to the Father.
39:2-3 We see that the ephod was woven of fine linen twined. The meaning of fine linen is explained in the book of Revelation to St. John 19:8 which represents the righteous deeds of the saints – “it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure”— for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.” (Revelation 19:8). God makes us from dirty sinners into righteous saints by the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus. That is the most incredible miracle.
39:4 The shoulder straps also represent Jesus because He is the one that caried our sin that we couldn’t carry ourselves. He carries us in when we surrender to Him, when we realize that we can’t do it on our own.
39:8-9 The breast piece is something we wear above our chest, above our hearts. God is written on all our hearts through the power of the Holy Spirit. It is square because a square has four sides pointing to North, East, South, West across the world. The reason why it is folded double is because Jesus paid double for our sins as stated in Isaiah 40:2 – “Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her
that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received from the Lord's hand double for all her sins.”
39:10-14 The stones are a part of the foundation of the New Jerusalem. What they represent is found in the book of Revelation. The first row of precious stones represents redemption (sardius), divine beauty of God (topaz), mercy and grace (carbuncle). The emerald in the second row represents the rainbow which, as explained in Revelation 4:3, represents Jesus who is sitting on the throne – “And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.” (Revelation 4:3). Sapphire represents the throne of God (Ezekiel 1:26). Diamond represents the heart, also diamonds are the strongest and purest meaning it shows purity and strength – “Diamond is unbreakable”. Jacinth from the third row represents divine presence, wisdom. Agate represents foundation and unity. Beryl from the fourth row symbolizes protection, faithfulness, the onyx is like the onyx which was on the shoulder, it represents remembrance and intersession because the high priest interceded for the people while carrying the names on his shoulders. Jasper represents the glory of God (Revelation 21:11). The stones were engraved with the names of the twelve sons of Israel which were engraved on the twelve gates of New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:12-13). Everything comes from Christ – strength, authority, purity, wisdom, divine presence, eternal life. All of the stones represent Jesus and his character. These stones were found in the garden of Eden in Ezekiel 28:13 and show that Jesus was there from the beginning.
39:15-21 Chains represent the unbreakable covenant Jesus made on the cross for us. The love of God is unbreakable and secure. It will never be loose.
39:22-23 God prepared for us a heavenly robe that is untearable. He wants us to wear it for the rest of our lives so that we would be his children that can never be snatched out of His hands.
39:24-26 Pomegranate is a fruit that when you crack open you find hundreds of seeds inside. Jesus the fruit and we are the seeds (John 15:9). Without his we can do nothing.
After the Israelites finished all of their work and followed every detail the Lord gave them, Moses put his approval of their work. When we do as the Lord says, he approves us and sees that we are trying. This applies to trying to sin less. When God sees that we are making progress and try not to sin as much as we used to because we love God, He approves of our work. That is how we can make the Lord satisfied, however, if our works are without faith then the Lord will not be pleased showing that Jesus is the main reason of our progress – “And without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing unto him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him.” (Hebrews 11:6).
Exodus chapter 40
The Israelites finish the job of building the tabernacle. Then a cloud came that filled the tabernacle with the glory of God. The glory of God was so strong that even Moses couldn’t enter the tabernacle. The Israelites would only go on their journey when the cloud rose from the tabernacle indicating that they always followed God and wanted Him to protect. Some decisions we make in life are our own selfish desires and then there is the decision God wants us to make. In order to find out what decisions God wants us to make in our lives, we must listen to His voice by reading the scripture, the gospel and if the decision we think of lines up with the Bible, then we know that the thought is from God. 
At the very end of Exodus, we see that God guards the tabernacle by providing a cloud during the day and a fire in the cloud at night. This is a reminder that God is always there and is always looking out for us, protecting us from deadly dangers and cares for us.
