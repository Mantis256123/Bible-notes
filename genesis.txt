Genesis chapter 1
An important thing to note is that Genesis chapter one and many chapters were not written to be extremely specific and scientific, back then what people cared about more were metaphors, overall main messages and not extremely specific details which is why many people don’t believe the Bible as it does not fully mention the things they were hoping to see such as at what time specifically did creation happen, but this is not the goal of the Bible. Moses was the author of this book which was inspired by God to tell the story of how the beginning started. God creates the fruit which foreshadows Adam and Eve’s fall by eating fruit and breaking God’s command. Fruit even foreshadows spiritual fruit that we produce after receiving the Holy Spirit and believing in Jesus. God made the fish and the birds. The reason fish and birds are mentioned is because they both must be born twice: firstly, when they lay eggs and secondly when they hatch. This is meaningful because we also are born again twice: firstly, when we are normally born and secondly when we are baptized with the holy spirit. Also, birds go against the flow by flying in the air and fish swim against the flow and when we are born again and follow Jesus, we go against the flow of the world. We are made in the image of God which means we are very valuable.
Genesis chapter 4
Cain and Abel both gave offerings to the Lord but only Abel was noticed. This made Cain mad, however God said that if you are doing good, then you will be noticed. And if you don’t do good, then sin is lurking, but you must master it, you don’t have to sin. If trash is in the trash can, then that is good, it becomes bad when trash leaves the trash can and that is when we sin. The reason why God might have only acknowledged Abel was because his offering was full, he put everything he had into it and Cains offering was whatever was left and meaningless to us. When it comes to prayer and spending time with God, do we give it are all? Do we spend time with our Lord first thing in the morning and sacrifice your time because we love God or do, we feel that it is a chore? In Mark 12, 38-44 when the widow gives 2 coins, she gives everything she had, and Jesus says that she gave more than anyone else and was noticed. That is because she trusted in the Lord and had faith that he will provide and that his sacrifice is worth giving everything away. To give everything means to have a lot of faith in the Lord. Let’s try to give everything we have for our Lord in terms of time, prayer and we will be noticed like Abel, love always requires sacrifice, make your time with God even more meaningful.
Genesis chapter 5
Henoch went with God for 300 years and the was taken by God. He was taken, so that he wouldn’t experience death (Hebrews 11, 5). This was because he walked by faith and trusted in God. Seth is Adam’s son and is born in Adam’s image and God made man male and female after his own image. And that makes men sons of God. This is recalled only in this chapter and not in Cain’s line in order to draw a sharp contrasts or distinction between the two lines. This line produces righteous men like Noah and Enoch while the other line produces murderers like Le’mach. 
Genesis chapter 6
Faith is everything, walk by faith
God made the human lifespan 120 years instead of 800-900, this is the max age that humans live to today. Some of the people became giants. And God SAW that people had become wicked (Genesis 6, 5). God saw us with his own eyes and in his eyes, we were wicked which means that this thoughts are true and ours aren’t. We mostly rely on our own thoughts, but our thoughts are evil, we often see things and think that they are good but in Gods eyes they are not. Only God is the one who is corrects so we must know his word to make correct decisions that God approves. You will find out what the correct choices are by reading the Bible because this book is God word which is good. Since people fell into sin and evil, God regretted creating humans (Genesis 6, 6). Because of this he decided to wipe out all of humanity and animals. He told Noah to build an Ark and gather pairs of all creatures on earth so that they could survive after the Flood. Noah listens to God, because his actions are always going to be the right choice. We should always listen to God instead of our hearts, event when it might seem unfair. It is impossible to be liked by God without faith and by having faith you will be rewarded (Hebrews 11, 6). Noah was informed by God and listened to him, had faith in him and rejected the world and became the heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. I can walk with the Lord today, the Lord offers hope to every one of us no matter what our situation is.
Genesis chapter 7
Noah was the only one that was righteous in God’s eyes and that is way more important than being right in the eyes of humans. It doesn’t matter how you lived before, but what matters is how you live now and today we need to be righteous with God. There is no righteousness in the side of God without obedience to the will and word of God. That is why reading the word and spending time with God is crucial.

Genesis chapter 8
Noah investigated if the land was save for a few months before getting out of the ark, he had a lot of patience and only left the ark after the heard from God that it was safe to leave. We often act fast based on what we see, but sometimes we need to listen to God’s voice and walk by faith, not by sight. God makes a promise to not destroy living creatures because of their sin and faults because humans are linked with sin from birth.
Genesis chapter 9
God makes a promise that he will never do the Flood again and won’t destroy earth (Genesis 9, 11). The rainbow is a sign that reminds us of his promise. God makes it clear that murder is prohibited (Genesis 9, 6). The reason why Ham cursed is because he saw Noah naked which was believed to be an expression of laying with the father’s wife which is considered a way of trying to dominate their father, that is why Noah cursed him. And Shem and Japheth did not do that and honored their father. And now Canaan is the enemy of the people of Israel. The family broke into two parts just like in Genesis chapter 5 where the family split in Cains and Seth’s line. We often act not according to God’s ways, our thoughts are often wicked and evil, that is why we need the Lord’s grace every day. There is a big contrast between Genesis chapter 3 and this chapter as in chapter 3 Adam and Eve did not feel shame when they were naked as there was no sin and only when they sinned they felt shame. In this chapter Ham told about Noah being naked to his brothers not feeling any shame for the sin but his brother’s did the opposite and understood that sin is serious and should not be made fun of. We all should take sin seriously as it is not some kind of joke but is offensive to God so we must repent of our sins and ask for forgiveness.
Genesis chapter 10
Family is important, God can change a families history. It is important be a good influence in your family as other generations depend on the previous families. All these names In this chapter show that God’s children are all over the planet and that these people would not have existed if it wasn’t for the previous families.
Genesis chapter 11
God mixed the languages of the people of Babylon. This was because they tried to reach Heaven by building a giant tower but God quickly switched their plan. Maybe there’s a reason why God gave us many different languages because if he had not done that, then the people might have become more powerful, arrogant and often empires end up being evil. Abraham came from a family that worshiped Idols and weren’t godly, this is mentioned in the book of Joshua. Just in chapter 9 Ham was cursed by Noah and now from the same family Abraham is born and God chose him to be a prophet? This tells us that no matter what happened in the past, God can choose you and you can become his servant.
Genesis chapter 12
God promises to make Abram or later known as Abraham into a great nation that will bless the world and live in Cainan. Only through Jesus these promises are perfectly kept. Jesus is the one that will complete these promises and make the current church. Abraham shows a great example of faith as he listen’s to God and goes to an area he has never been in. However, Abraham also showed fear as he asked his wife to pretend to be his sister and so pharaoh slept with her and took her as his wife which made God upset and he punished pharaoh for that. And now pharaoh kicked Abraham and his people out of his place.
Genesis chapter 13
Abraham and Lot become sperate, Lot lived in Sodom where people sinful against God and Abraham got the area of Canan. The Lords says that this is the place that he will give to him and his descendants. God promises to make Abraham’s descendants as large as there is dust in the world which means a very giant number and today there are billions of Christians.
Genesis chapter 14
The war between 4 kings happened and when the kings took over Abraham’s land and took his nephew, he sent 318 soldiers that won against the kings. Abraham was greeted my Melchizedek who offers bread and wine which symbolizes the last supper when Jesus turned bread and wine into his body and blood. Jesus is referred to the great priest Melchizedek’s way in Hebrews chapter 7. This is because Jesus did not pass away and it’s not an inherited priesthood, but Jesus is the great priest of all time, and he is like Melchizedek who has neither a beginning nor end. After this Abraham gave Melchizedek 10% of what he had. Abraham refuses to take the king of Sodom’s money because he doesn’t want to become rich through other people. Abraham is generous and faithful to God and will not take advantage of others and their money, he is fair and trusts God.
Genesis chapter 15
God makes a promise that Abraham’s descendants will be as large as the stars in the sky and Abraham trusted in God’s promise and God accounted it to him for righteousness. By hearing the word of God Abraham trusted in him more and grew in faith. The same thing goes for us. We can only grow in faith if we hear the word of God which means we have to read the Bible every day to grow in faith and love God even more.
Genesis chapter 16
Sarai asks Hagar to be the wife of Abraham so that they could produce a kid since Sarai couldn’t. But this idea was not suggested by God, and it ends up that the child Izmael is born to a slave and is not the promised child by God. Abrah tried to earn through effort what God promised through grace. When Jesus died on the cross, he took the punishment that we deserve, and we are the one’s who broke the covenant. No punishment remains for those who believe in Jesus. Instead, all that remains is the promise.
Genesis chapter 17
A few chapters ago God told Abraham that he will have a child. About two decades later God reminded them about the promise. This is a very long-time gap which might have caused some doubt in Abraham, but God’s promise just took time and patience. We often might not hear God’s voice which might lead us away from God. But faith requires patience and time. God’s time is always right. God says that Abraham will have another child with Sarah. Abraham laughs because he doesn’t understand how a child is born out of a ninety-year-old. God makes a covenant with all descendants of Abraham and his family for them to be circumcised. This is a good example of Abraham’s obedience. Even though he first laughed and doubted God, the very same day he did what God told him to do and circumcised everyone. This means that you don’t have to have perfect faith to obey God or be used by him. Even Abraham didn’t have perfect faith, but God still chose him.
Genesis chapter 18
God shows up in human form with two angels. God says that Sarah will have a child a year from now. Sarah does the same thing as Abraham did in the last chapter, she laughs. God responded to her unbelief by asking: “Is anything too hard for me?” Then Sarah denied that she laughed but that’s a lie, God sees the heart and everything you do. God showed up because he hears the cries of Sodom and Gomora, he always hears us. Then Abraham negotiates with God asking if he finds 50 righteous people, will he destroy the cities. Abraham negotiates all the way to only 10 people. God is always fair, and mercy and he will always make the right decision (Genesis 18, 25). Every time we are not sure about a situation, we are questioning God’s fairness, but his decision will always be fair. We must always trust him.
Genesis chapter 19
No one is good
The angels warn Lot that they will destroy the Sodom city and tell him to grab all his family and leave. However, some of them didn’t believe Lot and thought he was just joking. This may have been because Lot wasn’t fully committed to God. He was comfortable with the place where he lived and did not fully spent time with God. When God was destroying both Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot’s wife was looking back and so she was killed. This is an example of Jesus’s teaching of whoever tries to save their life, will loose it, but whoever loses it, will find it (Luke 17, 33). The way the cities were destroyed will be the same when Jesus returns (Luke 17, 30). The whole world is Sodom and Gomorrah because it is all evil and no one is righteous (Psalm 14, 3: “They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one.”). This isn’t the first time this has happened; the flood has already proved this. Currently in the place where the cities were destroyed is the Dead Sea, the land is dead. Lot and his children were saved because of Abraham’s righteousness. Jesus is the perfect righteous one, through him we are saved because of his righteousness. Jesus even says that it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgement that other towns that don’t believe in Jesus (Mathew 10, 15; 11, 23-24). In the end of the chapter Lot’s daughters get pregnant by their father because they were living in fear and did not trust God’s plan. They gave birth to people who were enemies of Israel. All this accomplished was negative effects, that is why we shouldn’t live by fear but by what God tells us to do.
Genesis chapter 20
Abraham once again chose fear over God because he said that his wife is his sister to avoid being killed. This time God warned Abimelech that he will be killed if he sleeps with Abraham’s wife and so nothing bad happens. We can often be walking by faith for a while and everything might be going great like it was for Abraham but sometimes we stumble and fall into sin again, however God is merciful and forgiving and he will forgive us if we repent. God also often preserves and saves us from a fall like he did to Abimelech so that he wouldn’t sin (Genesis 20, 6). But also, God lets us fall so that we would learn from our mistakes and learn to trust God more. Your failure doesn’t disqualify you. Also, it is important not to assume negative things about others when you don’t know. Abraham assumed that the was no fear of God in that place and the people were lost, didn’t have integrity, however the ones who didn’t have integrity here were Abraham and his wife, because of their assumptions. Just because someone doesn’t follow Jesus doesn’t mean they are worse than everybody else.
Genesis chapter 21
God’s promise is finally fulfilled, Isaac is born when Abraham is a hundred years old. When God first told his promise, Abraham was seventy-five years old. God always does thing his way and, in his time, his time might not always be the time we would like. Because of the long time period Sarah had become impatient, which lead to decisions that caused problems such as Sarah disliking the maid Hagar. Always remember that God’s plan is always right and if you decide to do thing your way, you may create problems.
